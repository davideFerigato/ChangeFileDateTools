## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Dual selection mode**: modify all files in the folder or select them individually via a graphical dialog.
- ✅ **Visual preview**: see the list of selected files before applying changes.
- ✅ **Custom date**: enter the desired date in `dd/MM/yyyy` format.
- ✅ **Realistic random time**: automatically assigns a random time between 08:00 and 20:00 to simulate working hours.
- ✅ **Smart error handling**: invalid date? You can retry or return to the main menu.
- ✅ **Continuous cycle**: modify multiple groups of files in sequence without restarting the script.

## 📦 Package Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ChangeFileDate.bat` | Batch launcher: opens PowerShell and runs the main script. |
| `ChangeFileDate.ps1` | Full PowerShell script with text-based interface and graphical file selection. |

---

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10, Windows 11 (or equivalent server versions)
- **PowerShell**: version 5.1 or higher (pre-installed on modern Windows)
- **Permissions**: read/write access to the files you want to modify
- **Graphical interface**: required only for manual selection mode (`S`)

---

## 🚀 Installation & Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/your-username/ChangeFileDateTools/releases) or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChangeFileDateTools.git
   ```
2. **Place** both files (`ChangeFileDate.bat` and `ChangeFileDate.ps1`) into the folder containing the files you want to modify.
3. **Run** `ChangeFileDate.bat` by double-clicking it.

> 💡 **Tip**: You can create a desktop shortcut to the `.bat` file for even quicker access.

---

## 🧭 Usage Guide

When you start the script, you will be presented with the following options:

1. **A** → Modify the date of **all** files in the script's folder.
2. **S** → Open a dialog window to **manually select** files (supports multi‑select with `Ctrl`).

After selection, the script displays the full list of chosen files and asks for confirmation.

Then:
- Enter the **date** in `dd/MM/yyyy` format (e.g., `15/03/2025`).
- If the date is valid, the script applies to each file:
  - 📅 **Creation date** = specified date + random time
  - 📅 **Modification date** = specified date + random time
  - 📅 **Access date** = specified date + random time

If the date is invalid:
- Press `R` to try again.
- Press `B` to go back to the initial choice (file selection).

When finished, you will be asked if you want to modify more files:
- `Y` → repeat the process
- `N` → exit the script

## 🎯 Practical Example

Imagine you have a folder `Documents/Work/Reports` with dozens of PDF and DOCX files generated on different dates. You want to standardize them all to **01/02/2025** to present them as a single coherent batch.

1. Copy the two scripts into the `Reports` folder.
2. Run `ChangeFileDate.bat`.
3. Choose `A` (all files).
4. Confirm the displayed list.
5. Enter `01/02/2025`.
6. The script applies the date with random times (e.g., 09:15, 14:30, 18:45).
7. Confirmation message: *"Dates successfully modified for 15 files."*

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🔒 **Do not rename** `ChangeFileDate.bat` and `ChangeFileDate.ps1`: the script relies on these exact names.
- 🔄 **The operation is irreversible**: once changed, the original dates are overwritten. We recommend backing up your files first.
- 🛡️ **Use with caution**: only modify dates if you are sure of the implications (e.g., legal documents, audits, archives).
- 📂 **Long paths**: if file paths exceed 260 characters, Windows may have limitations; ensure files are in accessible locations.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Batch script** (`.bat`) – for simple launching and compatibility with the classic Windows interface.
- **PowerShell** (`.ps1`) – for advanced logic, date handling, graphical dialogs, and file manipulation.
- **.NET Framework** – used by PowerShell for graphical components (`System.Windows.Forms`).
